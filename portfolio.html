                            <br>
                            <p> I was born and raised in Owensboro, Kentucky under my parents, Katie Riley and James Louis McCarley.  
                                As a free-spirited little girl, I faced some challenges of my own.  At the age of three, I had to learn how to function in this world while battling Level I Autism.  
                                Yes, it was tough living in a household of nine (four sisters, two brothers, and of course including myself).  I studied the violin at the age of ten and that has changed my life.  
                                I graduated from high school with honors on May 25, 1993 and attended Eastern Kentucky University in August of 1993.  In 1998, I attended Owensboro Community and Technical College and graduated in May 2000.  
                                Then, I attended Eastern Kentucky University off and on until I finally graduated with an Associates of Applied Science Degree in Computer Electronics Technology in December 2009.  
                                I would reside in Louisville, Kentucky in May 2010 working as a Help Desk Specialist.  Finally, in 2018, I returned back to Owensboro, Kentucky to care for my mother and myself until my mother's passing in May 27, 2021 from COVID-19.
                                Currently, I will be graduating in May with an Associates Degree in Computer Information Techology - Programming and also receiving five other certificates. 
                                Being unsure of my life's direction, my main focus is to pick up the pieces and live my life to the fullest.  If there is one thing that I would want people to learn from my story is to be the 
                                person that God wants you to be and to leave your mark in life.â€‹
